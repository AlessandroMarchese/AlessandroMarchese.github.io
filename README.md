# Alessandro Marchese  
*PhD Student in Machine Learning · Researcher*

Welcome to my personal site — a place where I share my research, projects, writings and academic journey in machine learning, causality and decision-making.

## About Me  
I am currently a PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), working within the Data Lab at the Brussels Humanities, Sciences & Engineering campus. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, decision making and applications in health/organ transplantation systems. For example, I co-authored work titled **“DynamITE: Optimal time‑sensitive organ offers using ITE”** (2025) which tackles dynamic organ allocation modelling and temporal decision processes. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
In previous work I have explored causal treatment effect estimation, sequential decision making, and the use of ML for healthcare systems. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## Research & Projects  
- **DynamITE**: A novel methodology for time‐sensitive organ allocation that explicitly models acceptance behaviours and cold ischemic times across sequential offers. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Additional ongoing projects: causal representation learning, event‐history modelling, simulation & decision-support systems in healthcare.  
- Publications, pre-prints and code repositories will be linked here as I publish them.

## What You’ll Find Here  
- **Publications & Media** – links to papers, slides, code and talks.  
- **Projects** – current research projects, collaborations and summaries.  
- **Blog / Thoughts** – posts on machine learning, causal inference, research practices, and academic life.  
- **CV & Contact** – for collaboration enquiries, speaking opportunities or academic networking.

## Why This Site  
I believe in open, reproducible research and in bridging methodological advances with real-world impact. My site is a transparent window into my journey – aiming to share not just *what* is being done, but *how* and *why* it matters.

## Get in Touch  
I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations and conversations.  
Feel free to reach out via email: **alessandro.marchese@vub.be** (or via the contact page linked in the nav).  
Let’s explore what we can learn and build together.
