# Alessandro Marchese  
*PhD Student in Machine Learning · Researcher*

Welcome to my personal site — a place where I share my research, projects,and academic journey in machine learning and causality.

## About Me  
I am currently a joint PhD student at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Universiteit Hasselt (UHasselt). My research interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning** and **causality**, often applied to healthcare systems. Previously, I have been an engineering student at KU Leuven.


### Get in Touch  
I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations and conversations.  
Feel free to reach out via email: **alessandro.marchese@vub.be** 
Let’s explore what we can build together.

## Research & Projects  
- [**CLEXNET <span style="color: rgb(138, 43, 226);">@NeurIPS 2025</span>**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=b8XmjZmsN0): A causal-explanation-guided model for organ-offer acceptance that learns policy-invariant representations using refusal-reason signals to improve generalization and predictive reliability.

- [**DynamITE <span style="color: rgb(0,150,0);">@ML4H 2024</span>**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlresearch/v259/main/assets/marchese25a/marchese25a.pdf): A novel methodology for time‐sensitive organ allocation that explicitly models acceptance behaviours and cold ischemic times across sequential offers.
